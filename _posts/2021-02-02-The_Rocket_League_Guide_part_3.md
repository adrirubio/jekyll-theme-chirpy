Well shall we get straight into it.

### Backbord Defence
The backbord is the big chunk of space on top of the goal.
To get to the backbord go up the wall next to the goal if you see the ball is going to hit the backbord, if needed jump of the backbord to save the ball.
##### Why Do You Need To Do This?????
Because in higher ranks players are going to aerial up to the ball from a backbord hit and it will most likely go in.

### Back Post Defence
##### What is Back Post Defence????
Well back post defence is if you split the pitch in half vertically, the side that does not have the ball is the one you are ment to rotate down in too.
That means you can save any shot.
But when you rotate down don't go in front of the goal post but slightly behind the goal.
