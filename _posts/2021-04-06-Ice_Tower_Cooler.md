## Ice Tower Cooler

Ok so this is my first blog post about a project, even 
though we are going to have lots, lots, more.
Trust me, so I don't want to keep you wating so lets get right into it.

### An Introduction
So you may be wondering what is a Raspberry Pi?
Well unless you live under a rock you will know what a Raspberry Pi is,
but not the one I am talking about,no, this type is a computer type.
YESS you read it, a computer, I don't mean a full on computer
a little one.Now don't leave because you think I am talking nonsens,
let me explane more.

### About The Raspberry Pi
Ok so just to let you know I am using a raspberry pi right now to write 
this blog (But of couse I am using it with the ice tower cooler). Back to the point, the raspberry pi
 measure 85.6mm Ã— 56.5mm.So what do you call that small or big?
 Ok, if you conect it to a screen you are good to go.
 
 You could swap your pc with a raspberry pi and you will be great,
 oh and to note to NOT buy the rasbperry pi to play video games because you will not 
 have the best games like Among Us or Rocket League,minecraft and lots more.
 Even though you get minecraft pi which is a bader version than minecraft.
 So I would not recomend buying it to just play games (It was ment for people to work),
 not to play.here is a link to buy the Raspberry pi if your interested?.(There are so many raspberry pi's this is the one I have)

### What Does The Ice Tower Cooler Do?
The ice tower cooler is a little fan that you conect to the top of the raspberry pi.
You may be wondering why, well its because sometimes the raspberry pi slows down
or turns of, thats because it's getting hot so it slows down. So there are less possibility for 
that to happen if you install the ice tower cooler. If you are interested go and buy it, oh and another upside is that
it has lights and they change color. [ice tower cooler](https://www.amazon.com/GeeekPi-Raspberry-Cooling-Cooler-Heatsink/dp/B07V35SXMC/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=ice+tower+cooler+for+raspberry+pi+4+ep-0107&qid=1617731765&sr=8-5)
