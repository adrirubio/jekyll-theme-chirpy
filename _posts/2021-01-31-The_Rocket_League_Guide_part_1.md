Ok so what I mean by this is, if you are an total beginer wich you probably are I recommend you freeplay!!! 
Just getting controle of your car and hitting the ball around easy as that.
##### Why Do This
Because most lower ranked players don't use freeplay as much as I recommend you, just 10 minits a day.
And in a few days you will see a huge diffrence in your game play!!
For some reason higher ranked players use freeplay ALOT, I am not saying it is a bad thing just in my opinion I think new players should use freeplay as much as higher ranked players or more!!!!!!!
 
### Play More Matches
Not much comes in to this one just play more matches you are going to lose and win !!
If you want try to think about one aspect of your game play!!
Like:Hitting the ball or demoing a player, you get what I mean don't you!!!

### Recommended Traning Packs
Okay todays traning packs are all the beginer psyonix traning packs!!!
They are going to help you out  ALOT so do feel free to use them.

Okay so I know it has been a pretty short number one guide I am sorry :(
Just the lower ranked players don't have much to do just freeplay more freeplay and more freeplay.
But that dose not mean that the other things I recommended you dont have use they will still help.

Well any way I hope you enjoyed and I will see you in the next one!!
