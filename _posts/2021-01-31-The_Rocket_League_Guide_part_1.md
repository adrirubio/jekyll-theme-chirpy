Ok so what I mean by this is, if you are an total beginer wich you probably are I recommend you freeplay!!! 
##### Why Do This
Because most lower ranked players don't use freeplay as much as I recommend you, just 10 minits a day.
And in a few days you will see a huge diffrence in your game play!!
For some reason higher ranked players use freeplay ALOT, I am not saying it is a bad thing just in my opinion I think new players should use freeplay as much as higher ranked players or more!!!!!!!
