## 3 Rocket League Tips For Total Beginners

Hi! today I will be talking about tips for people who installed Rocket League and only touched the controler once.
And like always the latest guide [The Rocket League Guide(Part #2)](https://adrianrubio.org/posts/The_Rocket_League_Guide_part_2/)!!!
Right lets just get right into it!!!!

### Freeplay Is Your Best Friend

Ok so what I mean by this is, if you are a total beginner which you probably are if you are reading this, I recommend you freeplay!!! 
Just getting control of your car and hitting the ball around, easy as that.
##### Why Do This
Because most lower ranked players don't use freeplay as much as I recommend you, just 10 minits a day.
And in a few days you will see a huge diffrence in your game play!!
For some reason higher ranked players use freeplay A LOT, I am not saying it is a bad thing, just in my opinion, I think new players should use freeplay as much as higher ranked players or more!!!!!!!
 
### Play More Matches

Not much comes in to this one; just play more matches, you are going to lose and win !!
If you want to try to think about one aspect of your game play!!
Like:Hitting the ball or demoing a player, you get what I mean don't you!!!

### Recommended Traning Packs
Okay todays traning packs are all the begginer psyonix traning packs!!!
They are going to help you out  A LOT so do feel free to use them.

Okay so I know it has been a pretty short number one guide I am sorry :(
Just the lower ranked players don't have much to do just freeplay, more freeplay and more freeplay.
But that does not mean that the other things I recommended you don't have use. They will still help.

Well anyway, I hope you enjoyed and I will see you in the next post!!
