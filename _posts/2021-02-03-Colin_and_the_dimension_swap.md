# Colin And The Dimension Swap (Chapter #1)

Colin started the day, like any other other ordinary day he got out of bed, suddenly something a little bit weird happened!!!.
The day re-started but Colin did not realise, he woke up and he saw some thing unusual!!!. He saw a slimy face in front of of him, Colin's head was about to pop!.
Colin heard the slimy monster say "honey, Joana is gone and and she is re-placed with a human person!!!," really terrifying.
Mr Monstor shouted back "be right up" when he came up he shouted out "what in the eternity of life is this!!!". During the same moment Colin put his pillow over his ears.
Mr Monstor was already dialing the nuber of uncle John but before he could finish Mrs Monstor mentioned that every time there was a problem he called uncle John (which was true). 

Mr Monster thought for a few seconds and then he addmited.
"You started this so you finish it" said Mr M "Fine" said Mrs M, Colin could not belive what he was hearing he had never seen a monster or a monster fight.
Too much happened in one day for Colin and he didn't even have breakfast yet!!
Finally Mrs M agreed to call uncle John Mr M was more than happy.
Colin could very barely hear John saying "be right there".
