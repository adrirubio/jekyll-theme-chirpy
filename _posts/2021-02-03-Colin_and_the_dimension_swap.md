Mr Monstor shouted back "be right up" when he came up he shouted out "what in the eternity of life is this!!!" During the same moment Colin put his pillow over his ears.
Mr Monstor was aleady dialing the nuber of unkle John but before he could finish Mrs Monster mentioned that every time there was a problem he called unkle John (witch was true).
